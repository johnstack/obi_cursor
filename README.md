# Obi Cursor

![Obi Cursor](https://github.com/johnstack/obi_cursor/blob/master/cursoranim.gif)

A legacy (Pre MacOS X) Macintosh system extension to replace the spinning beachball cursor with one that shows a cartoon of my old cat, Obi. 

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/johnstack/obi_cursor/blob/master/ObiCursor.zip) and move the extension file (see image below) into the Extensions folder in the System folder.

From what I remember, this works on System 7, MacOS 8 and MacOS 9.
